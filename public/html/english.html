      <h3>English Language</h3>
      <p>
        Let's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.

      <h3>Actual Analogies</h3>
      <p>
        <li>When she tried to sing, it sounded like a walrus giving birth to farm equipment.</li>
        <li>Her eyes twinkled, like the moustache of a man with a cold.</li>
        <li>She was like a magnet: Attractive from the back, repulsive from the front.</li>
        <li>The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.</li>
        <li>She grew on him like she was a colony of E. coli and he was room temperature Canadian beef.</li>
        <li>She had him like a toenail stuck in a shag carpet.</li>
        <li>The lamp just sat there, like an inanimate object.</li>
        <li>Her face was a perfect oval, like a circle that had two sides gently compressed by a Thigh Master.</li>
        <li>Her eyes were like the stars, not because they twinkle, but because they were so far apart.</li>
        <li>His career was blowing up like a man with a broken metal detector walking through an active minefield.</li>
        <li>The sun was below the watery horizon, like a diabetic grandma easing into a warm salt bath.</li>
        <li>From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole scene had an eerie, surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and Jeopardy comes at a 7:00 p.m. Instead of 7:30.</li>
        <li>It was as easy as taking candy from a diabetic man who no longer wishes to eat candy.</li>
        <li>She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes before it throws up.</li>
        <li>Their love burned with the fiery intensity of a urinary tract infection.</li>
        <li>It's basically an illusion and no different than if I were to imagine something else, like Batman riding a flying toaster.</li>
        <li>If it was any colder, it would be like being in a place that's a little colder than it is here.</li>
        <li>Joy fills her heart like a silent but deadly fart fills a room with no windows.</li>
        <li>The bird flew gracefully into the air like a man stepping on a landmine in zero gravity.</li>
        <li>He felt confused. As confused as a homeless man on house arrest.</li>
        <li>The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had disintegrated because of his wife's infidelity came as a rude shock, like a surcharge at a formerly surcharge-free ATM.</li>
