      <h1>Comparative Essay</h1>
      <h3>Question</h3>
      <p>
        To what extent has your comparative study of your two texts developed your understanding of the shared ideas, despite differing contexts.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Despite different cultures, continents and centuries, similar themes and ideas are excellently revealed in both texts. Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’ and ‘Ran’ by Akira Kurosawa both eminently develop the reader's understanding of power and chaos.
      </p>
      <h3>Body Paragraph 1 - King Lear Power</h3>
      <p>
        Power has the ability to manipulate, suppress and control as well as to heal if occurring in the form of pure love. The greed for power that corrupts the characters in Shakespeare’s  King Lear plays an extensive role throughout. When King Lear hands over his kingdom to his daughters in equal shares, he makes a  fatal error of judgement. This unmasks hidden features in the three children and sets in motion a brutal power game, filled with human cruelty and disaster. Once Regan and Goneril have gained full control, they are cold and cruel towards their father and later also towards each other. Using cumulative listing Goneril shows how the two sisters will do anything to keep the power of authority or to gain more: “Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, He may enguard his dotage with their powers”. Their desire for power and wealth poisons their personalities, destroys the family and disrupts the whole country. The third sister, Cordelia, remains devoted despite being wronged. She brings an army from a foreign country to rescue her father and both can experience forgiving love amidst the horror and chaos that engulf the rest of the play. King Lear learns to see the emptiness of worldly power and through suffering he comes to embrace the power of love of his daughter Cordelia as the one true value in his life.

      </p>
      <h3>Body Paragraph 2 - Ran Power</h3>
      <p>
        Ran has much from King Lear in it. The critical reflection on power of authority and its destructive forces on both individuals and whole societies plays an important role in the film, too. However, the tragedy is not so much centred on the old man, but has a fearful energy of its own. Hidetora, who has waged war all his life, finally understands that creating peace is the most important value in life.This matured insight and his attempt to impose peace onto his world unleashes even greater turmoil. Like King Lear, he divides his kingdom among his three sons, hoping this will bring peace. But the youngest son, who loves him most , tells him this will never work. So he gets banished but in contrast to Cordelia, he does not bring rescue, but joins the battle for power and control of the other two sons. Hidetora had controlled everything he saw, but he failed to keep enough power to pass on another set of values to the new generation. His battling children are drowning in a world seething with jealousy and greed. His own children have made him redundant and now he is powerless to change the world to the better.

      </p>
      <h3>Body Paragraph 3 - King Lear Chaos</h3>
      <p>
        In the Elizabethan era chaos was thought to be the result of a disorder in the “great chain of being” which described the worldview at that time. The stable, hierarchical order with the King at the top of the human realm falls apart the moment Lear decides to prematurely resign his power to his daughters. Disarray and the collapse of the whole political system followed suit. Mayhem in one area had repercussions on another one. Gloucester uses pathetic fallacy to foreshadow the chaos for the mortals in the play.“These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.” (scene 2, act 1). Both Gloucester and Lear lose their power to their wicked children, while their truly loving children are banished. The social world is out of joint,too. The failure of social and political order in the face of chaos recurs in Lear’s wanderings on the heath during the storm. Witnessing the powerful forces of the natural world, Lear comes to understand that he, like the rest of humankind, is insignificant in the world. This realization proves much more important than the realization of his loss of political control. He, re-prioritizes his values and becomes humble and caring. With this newfound understanding of himself, Lear hopes to be able to confront the chaos in his life.
      </p>
      <h3>Body Paragraph 4 - Ran Chaos</h3>
      <p>
        Kurosawa employs analogy and foreshadowing to show the major theme of chaos in ‘Ran’. In the film, Kurosawa challenges the strong japanese traditions of Inheritance and Rule. Living just after WW2, he notices the chaos of his society, as it tries to transition from the ancient Empirical system to the enforced western democracy. He also captures how many old traditions, are broken and replaced by new ones. The  opening scene begins with Hidetora, the ruler of the land, handing down his power and wealth to his three sons equally. This breaks the natural order of society and creates chaos, as traditionally, the eldest son would receive all, after his father's death. Saburo, the youngest son recognises this descent into chaos and tries to prevent it. This is reflected in Ran through the use of the arrow analogy. Hidetora uses the strength of three arrows to symbolize how his sons must stay together to stay strong. Saburo disagrees and shows that 3 arrows can still be broken, but in contrast to 1, they are not as flexible, suggesting that one ruler can control his land more adaptively than three. This argument between father and son reveals the descent into chaos. The title ‘Ran’ means chaos in Japanese which foreshadows the events to come. This initial disorder is a major theme throughout the film and powerfully manipulates the storyline.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Both texts, King Lear and Ran show that gaining power is one of the most powerful driving forces in human mankind throughout centuries. Quenching the thirst for power of authority is often linked with greed and corruption which leads political and social systems into chaos. Especially with the Trump presidency both texts from the past gain new relevance to judge our present. Coping with the change from a known stable order to chaos will promote understanding of worthy values and deeper insights into the true needs of humans. The reader will greatly benefit from the lessons of these reflections.
